# FCC File Metadata Analyzer

## This project is built to pass the tests implemented by FCC

## My Goals
- [ ] Use modern ES6 module based importing and exporting

If you would like to read the tests or implement your own version you can go to the [FreeCodeCamp File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/file-metadata-microservice) page.
